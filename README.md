# Landing Site (React + Vite)

This project is a **clean, original** landing page template inspired by common education/training sites.
It intentionally avoids copying any proprietary design assets or exact site text.

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Where to edit content

- `src/styles/*` – styling.

## Pages included

Replace the dummy image URLs with your real assets whenever you're ready.
